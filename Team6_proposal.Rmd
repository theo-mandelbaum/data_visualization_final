## Topics: Air quality, Pollution, Human Illness




### Project Idea/Research Question

How strongly does air quality / pollution contribute to risk of chronic respiratory illness?

#### Followup Questions

- How much more at risk are urban citizens in this context?
- What are some of the most dangerous counties to live in, regarding these factors?
- How has air quality worsened or improved over time and how has that affected chronic illness rates?



### Data and Data Source

#### Data on Chronic Disease Infection

[Link to Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators)

#### Here is a snippet of our data, specifically the way that the values are measured.

#### Next is a snippet of the metrics the we plan to use to sort our data; i.e. the location where the data is recorded.

#### Data on National Air Quality Metrics

### About the dataset

The link provided directs you to a webpage with a number of downloadable csv files. For our research, we are using the the Annual Summary Data, specifically the annual aqi data by county for the years from 2015-2021. So, we are using 7 different csv files, but they are all the same structure. The air quality is measure by AQI (Air Quality Index), which is a tool to report on air pollution levels, communicating potential health risks with a single number. The higher the AQI, the worse the air quality is.

#### Here are some snippets for the air quality metrics.

As you can see, each entry has a state, county, and year, allowing use to isolate big cities in the US. In terms of the data collection, we can see how many days deemed were healthy, unhealthy, unhealthy for sensitive groups, hazardous, etc. First, we will sort by state, as that's the data field that both of the data sets share in common. Once we've sorted the air quality data by states, we can compare the AQI measurements and the day totals, to other states.

Now that we've sorted our air quality data we can handle our chronic disease data. Similar to the air quality, we will sort the chronic diseases based on state; this field is called "LocationAbbr" in the chronic diseases data. In order to isolate respiratory illness, we'll sort this data by "Topic," specifying what type of disease the rows represents.

Once we've sorted both data sets as described above, we can answer the question; How strongly does air quality / pollution contribute to risk of chronic respiratory illness?


### Anticipated Results

- Urban Citizen risk: Categorized bar chart by level of urbanism, scatterplot(air quality vs population)
- Describing Dangerous Counties : detailed map color-coded by air quality
- Air Quality over time : line plot (x=time, y=quality) 



### Member Contributions
