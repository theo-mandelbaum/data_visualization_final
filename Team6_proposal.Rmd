## Topics: Air quality, Pollution, Human Illness




### Project Idea/Research Question

How strongly does air quality / pollution contribute to risk of chronic respiratory illness?

#### Followup Questions

- How much more at risk are urban citizens in this context?
- What are some of the most dangerous counties to live in, regarding these factors?
- How has air quality worsened or improved over time and how has that affected chronic illness rates?



### Data and Data Source

#### Data on Chronic Disease Infection

[Link to Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators)

#### Here is a snippet of our data, specifically the way tha the values are measured.

#### Next is a snippet of the metrics the we plan to use to sort our data; i.e. the location where the data is recorded.

#### Data on National Air Quality Metrics
[Link to Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-measures-on-the-national-environmental-health-tracking-network)

#### Now, a snippet for the air quality metrics.

### Anticipated Results

- Urban Citizen risk: Categorized bar chart by level of urbanism
- Describing Dangerous Counties : detailed map color-coded by air quality
- Air Quality over time : line plot (x=time, y=quality), scatterplot(air quality vs population)



### Member Contributions
Theo: Found chronic disease data set and examined how it relates to the air quality data set. Helped refine research question.
Rose:     
Joseph: Developed this file in coordination with team; examined data sources, created and refined research questions.
