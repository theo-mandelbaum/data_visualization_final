## Topics: Air quality, Pollution, Human Illness




### Project Idea/Research Question

How strongly does air quality / pollution contribute to risk of chronic respiratory illness?

#### Followup Questions

- How much more at risk are urban citizens in this context?
- What are some of the most dangerous counties to live in, regarding these factors?
- How has air quality worsened or improved over time and how has that affected chronic illness rates?



### Data and Data Source

#### Data on Chronic Disease Infection

[Link to Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators)


#### Data on National Air Quality Metrics
[Link to Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-measures-on-the-national-environmental-health-tracking-network)

![Example data selection]()



### Anticipated Results

- Urban Citizen risk: Categorized bar chart by level of urbanism
- Describing Dangerous Counties : detailed map color-coded by air quality
- Air Quality over time : line plot (x=time, y=quality), scatterplot(air quality vs population)
